1. PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system that extends the SQL language. It offers advanced features like complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, and transactional integrity.

2. SQL is a standard language for managing relational databases, while PostgreSQL is a specific database system that implements and extends SQL. PostgreSQL adds features like custom functions, inheritance, and more complex data types.

3. To connect to a database in psql, use the command:

4. WHERE filters rows before grouping, while HAVING filters after grouping. HAVING is used with aggregate functions, whereas WHERE is used for individual row conditions.

5. INNER JOIN returns only matching rows from both tables. OUTER JOIN returns all rows from one or both tables, including non-matching rows.

6. LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right. RIGHT OUTER JOIN does the opposite, returning all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left.

7. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. It abstracts database operations into object-oriented code.

8. AJAX requests are made from the client-side (browser) asynchronously, while server-side requests using libraries like 'requests' are synchronous and executed on the server. AJAX can update parts of a page without reloading, while server-side requests typically involve a full page reload.

9. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that tricks users into performing unwanted actions on a web application. CSRF tokens are unique, secret values generated by the server to prevent these attacks by ensuring requests come from legitimate sources.

10. form.hidden_tag() is used in Flask-WTF to generate a hidden field containing a CSRF token. It helps protect against CSRF attacks by including this token in form submissions.
